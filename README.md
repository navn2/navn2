## 🚀 Hey there, I’m Naveen!

Building. Breaking. Learning.  
I connect weird components, write questionable code, and somehow it works.  
AI | Electronics | Architecture  
Teaching circuits to behave and ideas to come alive.  
Engineering the kind of tech that refuses to stay ordinary.

### 🧪 What I Do
- 🛠️ Build hardware projects that look deceptively simple but do surprisingly cool things  
- 🤖 Train systems that *think* — machine learning, automation, and smart controls  
- ⚡ Experiment with circuits, controllers, and the stuff nobody reads datasheets for  
- 🎨 Blend architecture, design logic, and tech into functional innovation  


### 🧰 Tech Stack

**Hardware / Electronics**  
`Arduino` `ESP32` `555 Timer` `RF Modules` `Sensors` `Op-Amps`  

**Software / Tools**  
`Python` `MATLAB` `Simulink` `VS Code` `Render`  

**Concepts I Enjoy**  
`Machine Learning` `Control Systems` `Circuit Design` `Automation` `Human-Centered Tech`

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Making ML models not act like confused toddlers  
- Automating stability margins in smart systems (because normal margins are boring)

### 📬 Let’s Connect
If it sparks curiosity, I'm interested.  
Ideas, collabs, chaos — all welcome.
